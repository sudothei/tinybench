# tinybench

This script is:

- Tiny
- Fast
- Not totally accurate
- Only uses bash built-ins
- Doesn't need sudo

It is useful for:

- Extremely minimal performance reporting
- Lightweight benchmarking
- Not installing extra packages

Records the last 31 runs by default, but can be changed by changing the
`runsKept` variable

Is designed to be combined with something like cron for running every
day/hour/whatever
